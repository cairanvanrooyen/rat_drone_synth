# The 'RAT' Drone Synth

This repository describes my RAT (reverse avalanche transistor) drone synth which I have designed and built.

## Introduction and inspiration

This project was entirely inspired by the work by [Sam Battle](https://www.lookmumnocomputer.com/bio) of [Look Mum No Computer](https://www.lookmumnocomputer.com/). Sam released a video where he made a synthesiser from a Red Bull can - [watch it here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjrJeUBjw5g&t=1s). In his related post ['Super simple oscillator'](https://www.lookmumnocomputer.com/simplest-oscillator) he described more of the electronics and a few example schematics. There was also a link to a more technical description of reverse avalanche mode on a blog [BJT In Reverse Avalanche Mode by Kerry D. Wong](http://www.kerrywong.com/2014/03/19/bjt-in-reverse-avalanche-mode/). It was through both Sam's and Kerry's websites that I learned more about the SS9018.

[This page by 'Pixmusix'](https://core-electronics.com.au/projects/analogue-quad-oscillator-drone-synth/) is perhaps the best I have found so far on this type of oscillator, [its history](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/application-notes/an72f.pdf), how it works and some nice working examples. Pix also provide a very nice sketchy animation of this circuit in action.
